# Terraform and ARM Template Solution Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of a solution that utilizes Terraform, PowerShell, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for infrastructure provisioning and automation tasks related to Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) resources. The solution focuses on setting up AVD resources, including host pools, application groups, workspaces, and user assignments.

## Terraform Configuration

### Files

- `main.tf`: Contains the main Terraform configuration for creating AVD resources.
- `variables.tf`: Defines input variables used in the Terraform configuration.

### Terraform Resources

1. **Resource Group**: Defines an Azure resource group for organizing AVD resources.
2. **Virtual Desktop Host Pool**: Creates a host pool in AVD, which is a collection of Azure virtual machines used to host session-based desktops or virtual desktops.
3. **Virtual Desktop Application Group**: Configures an application group within AVD, enabling users to access published applications or full desktops.
4. **Virtual Desktop Workspace**: Sets up a workspace in AVD, which provides a logical grouping for AVD resources.
5. **Virtual Desktop Application Group User Assignments**: Associates users with application groups in AVD, granting them access to published applications or full desktops.

### Variables

- `resource_group_name`: Name of the Azure resource group.
- `location`: Azure region where resources will be deployed.
- `host_pool_name`: Name of the AVD host pool.
- `max_session_limit`: Maximum number of user sessions allowed per VM in the host pool.
- `load_balancer_type`: Type of load balancer used in the host pool.
- `app_group_name`: Name of the AVD application group.
- `workspace_name`: Name of the AVD workspace.
- `users`: List of user principal names for user assignments.

### Tasks

1. **Initialize Terraform**: Initializes Terraform in the working directory.
2. **Terraform Plan**: Generates an execution plan for Terraform changes.
3. **Terraform Apply**: Applies Terraform changes to create or update AVD resources.
4. **Terraform Destroy**: Destroys AVD resources provisioned by Terraform.

### Usage

```hcl
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Generate Terraform execution plan
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Apply Terraform changes
terraform apply tfplan

# Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
terraform destroy

```

## ARM Template

### ARM Files

- `azuredeploy.json`: ARM template for deploying AVD resources.
- `azuredeploy.parameters.json`: Parameters file for customizing ARM template deployment.

### ARM Template Resources

1. **Resource Group**: Defines an Azure resource group for organizing AVD resources.
2. **Virtual Desktop Host Pool**: Creates a host pool in AVD, which is a collection of Azure virtual machines used to host session-based desktops or virtual desktops.
3. **Virtual Desktop Application Group**: Configures an application group within AVD, enabling users to access published applications or full desktops.
4. **Virtual Desktop Workspace**: Sets up a workspace in AVD, which provides a logical grouping for AVD resources.
5. **Virtual Desktop Application Group User Assignments**: Associates users with application groups in AVD, granting them access to published applications or full desktops.

### ARM Template Parameters

- `resourceGroupName`: Name of the Azure resource group.
- `location`: Azure region where resources will be deployed.
- `hostPoolName`: Name of the AVD host pool.
- `maxSessionLimit`: Maximum number of user sessions allowed per VM in the host pool.
- `loadBalancerType`: Type of load balancer used in the host pool.
- `appGroupName`: Name of the AVD application group.
- `workspaceName`: Name of the AVD workspace.
- `users`: List of user principal names for user assignments.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive solution combines the infrastructure-as-code capabilities of Terraform, the automation power of PowerShell, and the declarative deployment model of ARM templates to streamline the deployment and management of Azure Virtual Desktop resources. By following the provided documentation and executing the appropriate scripts or templates, users can easily provision, update, and delete AVD resources as needed.
